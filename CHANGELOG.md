# Changelog

All notable changes to Mana are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

This file starts tracking from **0.2.0** — Mana has an extensive commit
history before this (`git log` has the full detail), but nothing summarized
it at a release level until now. Earlier work isn't reconstructed
retroactively; `0.1.0` below is a short baseline description, not a full
accounting.

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Cleared all 98 open Dependabot alerts: bumped `multer` (1.x -> 2.x),
  `electron-builder`/`app-builder-lib`/`builder-util-runtime` (24.x -> 26.x),
  `esbuild`, `requests`, `python-multipart`; overrode the dead-weight
  `gh-pages` transitive dep pulled in by `pixi-live2d-display` and the
  unreachable `@hono/node-server` pulled in by `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
  (`torch` was initially left pinned to `2.6.0` here because
  `chatterbox-tts==0.1.7` hard-required that exact version -- see below,
  since removed, so this no longer applies.)
- Fixed all 70 open CodeQL alerts: added an app-wide rate limiter
  (`express-rate-limit`) covering every node-bot route; gated the
  editor/workspace-control routes (`/zed/*`, `/editors/*`) behind admin auth
  after finding they were reachable unauthenticated with CORS wide open;
  added path-traversal validation to the pending-writes admin routes and
  `resolve_voice_ref` (tts-service); fixed a genuine ReDoS-shaped ambiguous
  regex in the mobile auth header parser and three others; fixed a real
  double-unescaping bug in `web-access.js`'s HTML-entity decoding; switched
  `auth-store.js`'s API-key hashing to salted scrypt with a migration path
  for existing accounts; added explicit `permissions:` blocks to all GitHub
  Actions workflows; and more (see PR for the full list).
- Bumped `electron` from 26.x to 39.8.10 in both `windows-launcher` and
  `desktop-client`, closing the remaining 34 Dependabot alerts. Verified by
  launching both apps and checking for real errors, and a full
  `electron-builder` packaging build for `desktop-client`.

### Removed
- **Chatterbox TTS provider**, at the user's request: deleted
  `tts-service/service.py` and `start.ps1`, and every `chatterbox`
  reference across `tts-runtime.js`, `server.js`, `doctor.js`, the
  `windows-launcher` process-management/UI code, and docs. This also
  freed `tts-service/requirements.txt`'s `torch`/`torchaudio` pins
  entirely (nothing else there needed them -- `kokoro-onnx` only needs
  `onnxruntime`), which is what was blocking the remaining torch
  Dependabot alerts.

### Changed
- `desktop-client`'s sidebar had Avatar/Web access/Market watch/Vision/
  Model/Doctor as top-level buttons alongside Settings; moved them inside
  Settings (a new "Status" section) to match `windows-launcher`, where
  they'd already been nested there since the issue #138 UI overhaul.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-27

This release exists primarily to verify the auto-update mechanism
(issue #120) end-to-end against a real published GitHub Release -- it also
folds in everything else that had accumulated on `main` since 0.2.1 but
never shipped in a tagged release.

### Added
- **Auto-update checking for `desktop-client`** via `electron-updater`
  against GitHub Releases. Both download and install are gated behind their
  own confirmation dialog, never automatic; `MANA_AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED=0`
  disables checks entirely (issue #120).
- **First-run setup wizard for `desktop-client`** (issue #123).
- **Portable Python bundled into the packaged installer**, so a system
  Python install is no longer required (issue #127).
- **Per-plugin enable/disable settings**, exposed in Settings (issue #131).
- **`desktop-client`**: closing screen, session browser, local model picker,
  and plugin toggle UI (issue #134 area).
- **Silero VAD** replaces the RMS-threshold speech/silence heuristic in
  `windows-launcher`'s continuous-listening loop, with a graceful fallback
  if the model is unavailable (issue #135).
- **`windows-launcher` UI overhaul**: popup info bubbles for
  Avatar/Web access/Vision/Model/Doctor, a redesigned horizontal Doctor
  panel, a startup loading screen, the Mana Crystal logo, a fuller Settings
  menu (Logs/Plugins), and a themed scrollbar (issue #138).
- A legally-clean default sample Live2D avatar (`npm run fetch-sample-avatar`),
  downloaded at setup time from Live2D's own CDN under their Free Material
  License -- not bundled into the installer, since that license doesn't
  permit redistribution.

### Changed
- `desktop-client`'s local data relocated out of the install directory,
  so an uninstall/reinstall doesn't touch user data in-place
  (issue #121).
- `desktop-client`'s avatar renderer rewritten to be context-isolation-safe
  (issue #122).
- `desktop-client` reskinned; sidebar nav wired to real functionality
  instead of placeholders.
- `plugins/` bundled into the packaged `desktop-client` build so the
  installed app can actually boot standalone (issue #124).
- Root README brought up to date with the actual current feature set,
  including a real screenshot instead of placeholder art.

### Fixed
- Several small backend/desktop-client reliability bugs (issue #129).
- `vector-rebuild-audit` test no longer clobbers the real audit log.
- Plugin test scripts fixed to survive a Node version change.
- Live2D avatar sizing and startup-timing bugs in `windows-launcher`.

### Docs
- Code-signing options documented for the desktop-client installer
  (groundwork for issue #119; signing itself isn't implemented yet -- builds
  are still unsigned, so both install and update still trigger a SmartScreen
  warning).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-14

### Removed
- **Sprite artwork removed from the public repo.** `sprites/` (all rights
  reserved, see `LICENSE-ARTWORK`) is no longer tracked — it's gitignored
  going forward, and its history was purged from the repository entirely.
  The desktop app degrades gracefully without it (the same pattern already
  used for the Live2D avatar model/runtime). This release supersedes
  `v0.2.0`, which has been deleted.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Live2D avatar ported into `desktop-client`** (the installer-packaged
  app): same driver as `windows-launcher`, with emotion-reactive states and
  RMS lip sync wired into the reply/audio flow, plus a zoom control and an
  always-visible in-app disclaimer banner. Clearly marked as a temporary
  testing placeholder, not the final avatar — see
  `desktop-client/AVATAR_NOTICE.md` for the miHoYo/HoYoverse attribution.
  Required temporarily enabling `nodeIntegration` for the desktop client's
  main window (documented tradeoff, scoped to this feature).
- **Setup automation script** (`tools/setup-mana.ps1`) for first-run npm
  installs across all three subprojects, `.env` scaffolding, model/binary
  directory creation, and a doctor report.
- **Built-in Live2D avatar** (`windows-launcher`): renders a Cubism model
  directly in the desktop UI instead of requiring VTube Studio. Drives
  emotion-appropriate motions/expressions from reply text (including
  kaomoji/emoji, not just English mood words), real-time lip sync, natural
  randomized blinking, a fixed-width zoom control (whole body / waist-up /
  bust-up), and an idle-tilt correction for models whose idle motion pitches
  back sharply. Every tuning knob (mouth gain, eye-open scale, blink/smile/
  brow parameter ids, idle tilt angles, state→motion/expression mapping) is
  configurable per-model via `mana-avatar.json`, so swapping the model
  folder is a drop-in operation — see `docs/live2d_avatar_setup.md`.
- **Silence-based voice endpointing**: Mana waits for an actual pause
  (~2.2s, tunable) before treating speech as a finished prompt, instead of
  cutting a long sentence off at a fixed duration.
- **Multilingual TTS**: automatic language detection with per-language
  Kokoro voice profiles (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean), instead of
  always speaking in English regardless of reply language.
- **Speech text normalization**: emoji/kaomoji become short spoken words
  ("smile", "sniff") instead of long Unicode names being read aloud,
  vowel-less interjections get pronounceable spellings, and a trailing "~"
  stretches the last vowel instead of being narrated as "tilde".
- **GPT-SoVITS** wired as an opt-in trial voice-cloning provider alongside
  Kokoro/Chatterbox/Fish Speech.
- **Self-hosted web access**: search, wiki lookups, and reading a page Mana
  is pointed at, backed by a local, single-user SearXNG instance rather than
  a public instance or third-party search API.
- **Persistent llama-server runtime** with CLI fallback, replacing
  spawn-per-request `llama-cli` calls; background memory-indexing jobs now
  run hourly, skip via content hash when nothing changed, and pause while a
  watched game has focus.
- **Local vision support**: screen/image description via a local
  Qwen2.5-VL model (`POST /vision/describe`, `image` field on `POST /reply`).

### Changed
- **Relicensed from PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 to Apache License 2.0**
  for the code, so GitHub's license picker/badge recognizes it. This
  permits commercial use of the code by others, a deliberate tradeoff for
  recognizability. Artwork (`sprites/`, `windows-launcher/avatar/model/`)
  is unaffected — still fully proprietary/all-rights-reserved under
  `LICENSE-ARTWORK`, independent of the code license either way.

### Fixed
- Closed two real gitignore gaps: personal voice-audition/reference audio
  was only untracked by luck (nothing actually ignored it), and Python
  `__pycache__` bytecode had been committed.

## [0.1.0] - 2026 (baseline)

Initial local-first voice assistant: wake-word listening, local speech
transcription (whisper.cpp), local reply generation (llama.cpp + GGUF
models), local TTS playback (Kokoro/Chatterbox), and the Windows Electron
launcher.
